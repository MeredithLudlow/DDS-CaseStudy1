# DDS-CaseStudy1
Authors: Meredith Ludlow & Kito Patterson

This is a repository for Case Study 1.  Analysis was done on beer and brewery data to analyze alcohol content and bitterness levels in different types of beer. To see the project output in Github, please refer to the Case Study PDF file.  

Items in the Repository:  
Beer.csv - Data set of beers made in the US.  
Brewery.csv - Data set of breweries in the US.   
CaseStudy.Rmd - Rmarkdown file for the project code.     
CaseStudy.md - MD file for the output of the CaseStudy.Rmd file.   
CaseStudy.html - HTML file for the output of the RMD file.    
CaseStudy.pdf - PDF file for the output of the RMD file.   
MLudlowPP - Meredith Ludlow's Power Point presentation for the project.  
CaseStudy_files - A file containing the output graphs from the RMD file.
